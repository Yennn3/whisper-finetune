# whisper-finetune
It provides a simple way to use your own dataset to fine-tune whisper-base. But it's best to mindful of the use of your dataset, datasets that is only a few hours will not lead to a visible improvement. If you want to fine-tune a language that has never been trained on Whisper, you can try setting the baseline language to a language from the same language family as the one you want to fine-tune.
